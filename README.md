<b>Week 2</b>
</br>
Members present: List the NetID of the people who attended the meeting
</br>
Meeting notes: Explain the overall team progress and a summary of discussion
</br>
1. Code Review - Pull Request Process 
  <br>At least 1 person review and approves the codes to avoid accidental mistakes. 
2. Meeting Time Discussion and Asynchronous Updates as needed 
  <br>As we have a closer deadline, we are going to meet twice next week; Wednesday at 10 p.m. CDT (12th) and Saturday at 9:30 p.m. CDT (15th) 
3. Team Consensus Agreements 
  <br>If or when a team member is unable to attend a meeting, the member(s) will inform his/her/their updates of the assigned task(s). However, we encourage all teammembers to attend the weekly meeting.  
  Weekly meetings can be recorded, but the manager is required to update the meeting notes and communicate to the members, so everyone shares the same information. Also, additional meeting will be conducted as needed. 
  <br>Even tasks are allocated to each team member, all members are encouraged to support each other. 
4. Task Deledations
  <br>As we have four sections of deliverables, our team decided to divide the tasks and apply a pair of members to each task. In other words, two team members work together to complete the task. We also created and shared a document to brainstorm requirements and use cases.     
  <br>4.1 Informal Requiremnets: Michael Levine
  <br>4.2 Fully Dressed use Cases:  Akio Orihara 
  <br>4.3 Class Diagram: Seoungdeok Jeon Jeon and Kyr Nastahunin
  <br>4.4 Component Transition Graph: Chi Lui and YijunWang
